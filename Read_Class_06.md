## Random Module

It use to pick a random number in a given range Pick a random element from a list, pick a random card from a deck, flip a coin etc...

### Random functions
- Randint
   ```
   import random
   print random.randint(0, 5)
   
   output => random integer number from 1 to 5
   
   ```
 - Choice
    ```
    import random
    my_list = ["one" , 2 , 3 , "string" , None]
    ss = random.choice(my_list)
    print(ss) 
    
     output => will print one index randomly
    ```
    
 - Shuffle
    The shuffle function, shuffles the elements in list in place, so they are in a random order.
    ```
    from random import shuffle
    x = [1,2,3,4,5]

    print(x)
    
     output =>  will print the list in different ordere each time will sort the indexes randomly
    ```
    
    

## Risk Analysis

 A risk analysis performed during software testing helps to identify areas where software flaws could result in serious issues in production. By identifying areas of concern early, developers are able to proactively remediate and reduce the overall risk of a production defect

 Implementing risk analysis in software testing typically requires a detailed evaluation of the source code to identify how it interacts with other components of a complete application. This evaluation looks at the various code components and maps how the code interacts.
