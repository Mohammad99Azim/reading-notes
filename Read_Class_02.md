# TDD(Test Driven Development)

As the name suggests, we should first add the test before adding the functionality in our code.

Now our target is to make the test pass by adding new code to our program. So we refactor our code to pass the written test.


# if __name__ == “__main__”
This pice of code you will need it when you import a module inside the module somtimes there is some code you won't it be execute in the main file(the file contain the import)

so the magic var __name__ if the file was imported from another module the value of it will be the name of the module on the other hand if you run the file that

contain the __name__ variable the value of it will be "__main__" so using this if statment you can avoid running some code when your file is imported and still have the

result as it is if you run the file directly.


# Recursion
It is what we call a function when it call it self  (Recursion Function) some problems you can't solve it without using the recursion.
and the recursion call it selfe but with new arguments every time and have break point to avoided the infinity looping.


# PyTest 
is a testing framework that allows users to write test codes using Python programming language.
it will help you to write a test to testing you code and the Database,API etc.
