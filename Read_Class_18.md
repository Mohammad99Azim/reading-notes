# Encryption, decryption, and cracking

### Encryption
Encryption in cyber security is the conversion of data from a readable format into an encoded format. Encrypted data can only be read or processed after it's been decrypted.
Encryption is the basic building block of data security.

One of the earliest encryption techniques is the Caesar Cipher, invented by Julius Caesar more than two thousand years ago to communicate messages to his allies.

The Caesar Cipher is a great introduction to encryption, decryption, and code cracking, thanks to its simplicity.

Ex :
Encrypting a message

Imagine Caesar wants to send this message:

``SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE``

Here's what that might look like encrypted:

``YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK``

To make the encrypted message above, shift the alphabet by 6 and used this substitution table:

A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z

G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	A	B	C	D	E	F


S shifts 6 letters over to Y, E shifts 6 letters over to K, etc. Here's the first word and its shifts:

S	E	C	R	E	T

Y	K	I	X	K	Z


### Decrypting 

The conversion of encrypted data into its original form is called Decryption. It is generally a reverse process of encryption. It decodes the encrypted information so that an authorized user can only decrypt the data because decryption requires a secret key or password.



Imagine Caesar sends this message to a comrade:

EHZDUH EUXWXV

The comrade uses this substitution table, where the alphabet is shifted by 3:

A	B	C	D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z

D	E	F	G	H	I	J	K	L	M	N	O	P	Q	R	S	T	U	V	W	X	Y	Z	A	B	C

They can then decode the message with certainty. The first letter "E" was shifted by 3 from "B", the second letter "H" was shifted by 3 from "E", etc. The result is this ominous message:


BEWARE BRUTUS


### Cracking

Cracking is when someone performs a security hack for criminal or malicious reasons, and the person is called a “cracker.” Just like a bank robber cracks a safe by skillfully manipulating its lock, a cracker breaks into a computer system, program, or account with the aid of their technical wizardry.



Imagine that a very literate and savvy enemy intercepts one of Caesar's messages.

RZ VMZ WMDIBDIB VGG AJMXZN OJ EJDI RDOC XGZJKVOMV OJ YZAZVO OCZ ZIZHT LPZZI VO OCZ IDGZ YZGOV

That enemy does not know that Caesar always uses a shift of 3, so he must attempt to "crack" the cipher without knowing the shift.
