#  Numpy
 - NumPy Is A Python Third-Party Module To Deal With Arrays & Matrices
 - NumPy Stand For Numerical Python
 - NumPy Is Open Source
 - NumPy Support Dealing With Large Multidimensional Arrays & Matrices
 - NumPy Has Many Mathematical Functions To Deal With This Elements


### Why We Use NumPy Array
- Consume Less Memory
- Very Fast Compared To Python List
- Easy To Use
- Support Element Wise Operation
- Elements Are Stored Contiguous


#### Note !!!
Numbpy Arrays & Matrices are Heterogeneous => Can Contains Different Types of Objects.
- The Items in The Array Have to Be Of The Same Type
- You Can Be Sure Whats The Storage Size Needed for The Array 
- NumPy Arrays Are Indexed From 0


### Numpy vs List

Numpy is Faster and use less Space 

Lists can have multi type of values



# JupyterLab

JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data. Its flexible interface allows users to configure and arrange workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning. 
A modular design invites extensions to expand and enrich functionality.


### Accessing JupyterLab
JupyterLab in IBM Watson Studio includes the extension for accessing a Git repository which allows working in repository branches. To use JupyterLab to work on notebooks or Python scripts for example, you must create a project that is integrated with GIT and enables editing notebooks only with the JupyterLab IDE.
